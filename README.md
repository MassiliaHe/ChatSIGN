# Sign Language Communication with ChatGPT

## Overview

This project is dedicated to creating an innovative sign language communication application that integrates with ChatGPT to translate sign language into natural language and vice versa. Leveraging deep learning and computer vision technologies, including MediaPipe, the system accurately recognizes and tracks hand gestures to provide seamless and precise translations.

## Features

- **Gesture Recognition**: Utilizes computer vision to detect and interpret sign language gestures.
- **Real-Time Translation**: Translates sign language into text, which is then processed by ChatGPT to generate responses.
- **Animated Responses**: Converts ChatGPT's responses back into sign language animations for complete bidirectional communication.
